Apps like Venmo, Robinhood, and Chime have taken the world by storm, enamoring anyone with a smartphone. The fintech revolution has brought about a slew of companies all with the same objective: disrupt the hell out of old-fashioned finance.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This sort of arrogance, the nerve to suggest that the &ldquo;too-big-to-fail&rdquo; financial&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">institutions</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">&nbsp;we have all begrudgingly accepted as the keepers of our hard-earned money were doing something wrong, ruffled feathers at the very top. After all, only health is put above wealth, if even that. Regardless, fintechs the world over strived to change the way we approach activities from payments, getting insurance, and even accessing capital markets and securing loans. Regulatory pushback has been immense, and even today with the surge in popularity of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream, the future is all but certain.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Through the fog of fintechs in the industry, three companies have clearly made their way to the top: Square (SQ), Shopify (SHOP), and Paypal (PYPL). All three firms have fundamentally changed the way money flows both in e-commerce and in brick-and-mortar settings. Between POS systems, small business loans, e-commerce payment, and product fulfillment services, it is safe to say 2021&rsquo;s shopping scene has these firms&rsquo; fingerprints all over them. Now let&rsquo;s take a deep dive into whether or not they are good investment opportunities (in my opinion).</span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Square (SQ)</strong></span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">By market cap Square is the smallest of the three, but with a Price/Earnings to Growth ratio (PEG) of 3.04 and a Year Over Year (YoY) growth rate of over 100% since 2018 it is almost an understatement to say it is absolute dynamite. Led by an experienced management team and John Dorsey (CEO and Co-founder of Twitter as well) at the helm, Square has been consistently creating new product lines and avenues for growth in the past few years. This emphasis on reinvesting shows up in their financials as short-term investments have risen from around $250 million to almost $4 billion since 2017 and invested capital has grown over 500% to $5.7 billion in the same time. Keeping investment as a priority does mean that Square&rsquo;s earnings are often lower than their peers&rsquo; so Return on Assets and Equity in the future will be metrics to watch. Generally speaking though, the &ldquo;intelligent investor&rdquo; as defined by Benjamin Graham would be somewhat skeptical about investing in Square at the current price levels due to the stock&rsquo;s propensity to drop off a cliff at any less than stellar results or a drop in bitcoin price and such. As a result, bulls and bears could both stand to profit depending on entry point but at the moment since the volatility seems to be baked into the price I&rsquo;m hesitant to go all in.</span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Shopify (SHOP)</strong></span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Shopify falls between Square and Paypal both in terms of market cap at growth potential. Profits and revenue have both tripled since 2018 while earnings have steadily grown from losing about $0.50 per share to an EPS of over $12 in 2021 (TTM). Explosive growth paired with a current ratio of over 10:1, Shopify seems geared to enjoy sustained success in the near future. Even though a price of over $1400 per share seems a bit rich for many retail investors&rsquo; tastes, and there is definitely a premium due to future growth being taken into account, there is no denying Shopify&rsquo;s potential. Shopify&rsquo;s competitive advantage is enviable, with over 8% of all US e-commerce flowing through their channels. In addition, when Shopify&rsquo;s $1 billion fulfillment network (SFN) is full up and running they intend to compete even with Amazon&rsquo;s Prime delivery, delivering 30,000 items per merchant per day.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">With Shopify, however, a few issues persist. Firstly, the company currently focuses on small and medium businesses, which are typically much more open to the idea of outsourcing the logistics of payment and fulfillment. If the pandemic is any indication of the way the economy in the 2020s will react to the next recession then this focus on smaller firms might be an issue. In economic downturns, smaller businesses tend to struggle and this might hamstring Shopify&rsquo;s numbers as well. The last consideration would have to be that in the near future Shopify will have to battle with other fintech firms like Square, Woocommerce, and in the future even Salesforce and Amazon for the rights to the e-commerce and fulfillment crown. At the moment I am bullish on Shopify but I feel like the current entry point is risky and the next 12 to 18 months could prove to be very telling of Shopify&rsquo;s future. I would wait to buy at a lower price or at a point when profitability is significantly higher or they are able to establish a more robust fulfillment network to ensure they stay ahead of the prospective competition.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>Paypal (PYPL)</strong></span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At last, we come to Paypal. Paypal is just the archetypal fintech firm; deeply rooted in innovation but with the advantage of age in its corner. Founded in 1998, weathering two market crashes in 2001 and 2008, Paypal has done its investors proud. Even today, 23 years after its inception, Paypal boasts a YoY revenue growth of over 20% while maintaining high enough earnings to ensure a PE below 80 while its price has skyrocketed. With a variety of product lines (Xoom, Braintree, and Venmo to name a few) and fantastic Free Cash Flows of over $5 billion in the last 12 months, Paypal&rsquo;s growth has been impressive and seemingly sustainable. Paypal is currently undertaking a quite large stock buyback program which may lightly influence prices but given trajectories, estimated growth, and forward PE, the state of its options market, and its impressive ability to sustainably grow YoY, Paypal seems to be on the right path. Unlike both Shopify and Square, founders no longer hold much stock, but insider holdings of over 0.12% at a 300bn market cap is no small matter either. Although a buy in my book, it will be interesting to watch as Paypal pushes to increase usership globally and continues to pave the way to a cashless society.</span></span></p>
<h3 dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; color: rgb(67, 67, 67); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"><strong>So Where Does This Leave Us?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.7999999999999998;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Frankly speaking in this discussion we&rsquo;re being somewhat nitpicky and each stock has its value without a doubt. The more defensive investor will be able to sleep well knowing its money is safe with Paypal while the more enterprising might indulge Shopify and Square and attempt to make a tidy profit. What is definite is the impact these three firms have had in digital payments and the fintech industry overall. The world has been shifting to a cashless society and Square, Shopify and Paypal are at the cutting edge of this trend. Which blade will you choose?</span></p>
