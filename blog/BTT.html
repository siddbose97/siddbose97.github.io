<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.16;margin-top:16pt;margin-bottom:4pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">I think I&rsquo;m a decent &ldquo;googler&rdquo; but for the life of me I could not find out what an &ldquo;Armt Tech&rdquo; in the Singapore Armed Forces did. This, coupled with the fact that no one in my platoon knew either, meant that my anxiety was at a new high. On July 13th I showed up to Kranji Camp 3, home of OES (OETI Engineering School). This acronym-within-an-acronym monstrosity turned out to be one of the most interesting places I&rsquo;ve been.</span></p>

Depending on our NRIC&rsquo;s (National Registration Identity Cards) we either showed up early in the morning or in the afternoon. By the time I got to OES it was pouring rain, and as a proud Angeleno I had forgotten to bring an umbrella or a raincoat. Eventually we were set up in our new bunks (which were phenomenal. Imagine a cabin in the woods, but add 8 other smelly guys) and we walked into our classroom. After having spent weeks being yelled at by sergeants and officers, it was very odd to be in a classroom setting. Our instructors, Mr. Ng and SQ were both civilians and didn&rsquo;t really push the military etiquette too hard. I found out later though that Mr. Ng used to be ME4 Ng, the deputy commander of the heavy arms maintenance division. He moved over to teaching after getting sick of the paperwork involved in management.</span></p>

I was specifically placed in the HASA cohort, which stands for Heavy Arms/Small Arms. The alternative was the Turret cohort, which works on tank-mounted guns. The first 9 weeks of BTT were focused on heavy arms and more specifically the FH2000. This giant weapon was part cannon and part military vehicle. For 9 weeks we learned how to disassemble and reassemble virtually every part of the weapon. Parts included pressurized cylinders used to hold up the 1 ton barrel, the hatch mechanism and even the engine of the weapon. I had never considered myself the handiest of handymen before this experience, but by the time I was done in early September, I knew my way around a set of spanners like nobody&rsquo;s business. It got to the point where we could walk around the weapon, point at a random nut and be able to guess, within a couple of sizes, which spanner to use. I found myself loving manual labor like I never thought I would; the uncomfortable military coveralls, the pressurized nitrogen and oil spewing everywhere and even carrying awkward components through crevices in the weapon&rsquo;s chassis was all genuinely enjoyable. I will say, however, that it was becoming remarkably &ldquo;normal&rdquo; to work on the gun. It didn&rsquo;t feel like the killing machine it was designed to be; it was just work.&nbsp;</span></p> <br><br>
<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:2.16;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">The last few weeks of BTT were a blur. We had to learn how to strip and repair eight different guns in a matter of 12 in-camp days. We started off with the SAR21; we were all familiar with the workings of the gun from BMT and so this was relatively simple. Then we moved onto the SAW (Section Assault Weapon), a light machine gun with an open-bolt design. Not only did this gun have 3 variants with their own little tips and tricks, but with an open bolt weapon, the spring is just waiting to take your fingers off. It was a bit difficult to work with the SAW but eventually we got it down. The next three guns were heavy duty weaponry: the GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun), the CIS 40 AGL (Automatic Grenade Launcher) and the CIS 50 HMG (Heavy Machine Guns). For the first time in the small arms section of the course, the majority of the people in my cohort were unable to even cock the gun, let alone strip it alone. The spring tension the guns used to propel the large projectiles at breakneck speeds was unbelievable. The last two guns were a treat: the Sig Sauer P226 and P30 pistols. Again, the weapons stopped feeling like weapons and became &ldquo;work&rdquo;. We would compete to see who could strip and assemble the pistols first, and then tried the same blindfolded. The information overload was real for sure but the experience was amazing.&nbsp;</span></p>

Little did I know this would be my next home!</span></p>
