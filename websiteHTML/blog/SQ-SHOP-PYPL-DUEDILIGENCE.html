                            <div class="text"><h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">Square: </h3><h5 style="margin-left: 25px;">SQ offers a classic blend of high risk high reward and has been for years now. Square’s gross profits have been growing steadily over the years but earnings per share have been negative all the way until 2019, indicating that there is some way to go for Square to become the industry stalwart it wants to<h5>be. Boasting an impressive management team one would assume the return on<br>equity and investment would be equally as impressive but when compared to<br>industry competitors or even veteran companies with lower growth rates, like<br>Apple and Google, these numbers are far from. Currently, and self admittedly,<br>Square is focusing on establishing product lines, maintaining and growing their customer base on their multiple platforms and trying to navigate the<br>cryptocurrency climate they have heavily invested into (both as a direct investment and as an offering on the Cash App). The next few years look to be as volatile as the last few for Square with wild swings in the 30-40% range to be expected. At the current price, when compared to both Paypal and Shopify, it seems as though it is less than a bargain. If you are to invest now, prepare to buy the dips as there is no guarantee that any given resistance and support determined by so called “Technical Analysis” will hold.</h5></h5><p style="margin-left: 25px;">i. Current View: If invested, buy on dips but don’t try and chase</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">b. Paypal: PYPL is the archetypal fintech firm, deeply rooted in innovation but has</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">the advantage of age in it’s corner. Started in 1998, weathering the bursting of</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">two bubbles in 2001 and 2008, Paypal has done its investors proud overall. It’s</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">product lines are relatively varied, between Xoom, Venmo and the base Paypal</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">offering, and don’t rely specifically on any one customer segment. Although</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">growth has slowed over the years, Paypal manages to keep a relatively stable</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">Debt-to Equity Ratio while growing assets and investments. Paypal is currently</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">undertaking a quite large stock buyback program which may lightly influence</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">prices but given trajectories, estimated growth and forward PE, the state of it’s</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">options market and its impressive ability to sustainably grow YoY, Paypal</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">seems to be on the right path. Unlike both Shopify and Square, founders no</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">longer hold much stock, but insider holdings of over 0.12% at a 300bn market</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">cap is no small matter either.</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">i. Current View: Extend current holdings in Paypal but monitor</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">resistances at 275 and supports at 175 as well</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">c. Shopify: SHOP took the world by storm, and for those who are as entrenched</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">into the online shopping scene as most millennials will know the ubiquity of</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">the platform. Boasting strong revenue growth and return on assets and equity</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">the firm seems to have a bright future. With Shopify, however, a few issues</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">persist. Firstly, the company focuses on small and medium businesses, which</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">are typically much more open to the idea of outsourcing the logistics of</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">payment and fulfillment. If the pandemic is any indication of the way the</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">economy in the 2020’s will react to the next recession then this focus on</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">smaller firms might be an issue. In economic downturns, the smaller</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">businesses tend to struggle and this might hamstring Shopify’s numbers as</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">well. Currently insiders hold 0.3%, which is again impressive, but when</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">compared to the 10% holding of the CEO, this is dwarfed. Shopify will have to</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">battle with other fintech firms like Square, Woocommerce and in the future</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">even Salesforce and Amazon. Many believe that scale is sufficient to keep</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">Shopify in the front seat for the future but I believe that a million clients today</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">is not enough to fully corner the market. Shopify is still focusing a lot on its</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">capital investments and its profitability is suffering as a result. It’s stock price,</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">although high, is highly volatile in part due to its small float. I think in order to</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">be a sure-fire buy in the near future, the company will have to focus on</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">profitability, expanding their customer base to larger companies, establishing</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">an even larger fulfillment network (size and scale truly matters in the logistics</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">business) and forming corporate alliances to shore up the competitive</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">advantage they have today.</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">i. Current View: More enthusiastic on Shopify than Square but would still</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">be skeptical about going in too hard right now. I would wait to buy at a</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">lower price or at a point when profitability is significantly higher or</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">they are able to establish a more robust fulfillment network to ensure</p><p style="margin-left: 25px;">they stay ahead of prospective competition</p></div>
